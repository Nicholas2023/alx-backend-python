## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```

- `0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests/`: Contains test files for different tasks.
- `fixtures.py`: Contains fixture data for integration tests.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and its tasks.

## Tasks Overview

The tasks in this project cover a range of testing concepts:

1. **Unit Testing**: Writing tests using `unittest.TestCase`, parameterizing tests, and testing expected outputs.
2. **Mocking HTTP Calls**: Using `unittest.mock.patch` to mock HTTP requests and test without making actual external calls.
3. **Parameterization and Patching**: Testing memoization, parameterizing methods, and using decorators to mock HTTP calls.
4. **Integration Testing**: Implementing tests using fixtures and mocking external requests.

## Task Details

### Task 1: Parameterize a Unit Test

- Writing unit tests for specific functions using `unittest.TestCase`.
- Parameterizing tests to cover multiple inputs and testing expected outputs.

### Task 2: Parameterize a Unit Test for Exceptions

- Testing exception handling using `assertRaises`.
- Verifying the raised exceptions and their messages for different inputs.

### Task 3: Mock HTTP Calls

- Testing functions involving HTTP requests without making actual calls.
- Using `unittest.mock.patch` to mock HTTP calls and verify outputs.

### ... (Continue detailing each task similarly)

## Getting Started

To run these tests locally, ensure you have Python installed.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the relevant task directory (e.g., `0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests`).
3. Run the tests using a command-line test runner or IDE supporting Python testing.

## Usage

Each task directory contains the necessary test files. Run individual test files or the entire suite to verify functionality.

Example:

```bash
python -m unittest test_utils.py
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request with improvements or additional tests.
